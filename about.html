                We are a definitely real, and not-at-all made up cafe and restaurant, home to the world's best Waffle-Grandes!
                Founded at some point, this world class cafe has almost-certainly been host to a number of famous chefs who probably
                said good things.

                The Waffle-Grande, for those of you who don't know, is our infamous waffle made using our secret recipe! You won't find any
                other waffles like ours!
